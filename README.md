# Decider
This is a simple app for deciding which option to choose. The user simply inputs the options available and the app will choose one at random.

For example, choosing what to watch on a Saturday evening between a number of delightful choices (The Witcher or One Piece). Simply enter each option into the program and select "choose" and it will decide for you. Badabingbadaboom. Problem solved.
